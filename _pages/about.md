I am a computer science researcher and a research associate at <a href='https://en.sbu.ac.ir/'>Shahid Beheshti University (SBU)</a> in the <a href='https://enimsat.sbu.ac.ir/neuroscience-and-neuroengineering/'>Neuroengineering Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href= 'https://www.ipm.ir/personalinfo.jsp?PeopleCode=IP0400047' >Dr. Reza Lashgari</a>. My research primarily focuses on computer vision, deep learning, and computational neuroscience. I am also actively involved in AI-driven biomedical imaging and smart contract optimization.

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), where I worked on gas optimization in smart contracts using program analysis under the supervision of <a href='https://aut.ac.ir/cv/2340/Ali%20Mohades%20Khorasani'>Dr. Ali Mohades</a>. My bachelorâ€™s degree is from <a href= 'https://cse.shirazu.ac.ir/> CSE department</a> at <a href='https://shirazu.ac.ir/en/home'>Shiraz University</a>, where I specialized in artificial intelligence and software engineering.

I have also collaborated with international research teams, including a project with the University of Utah, where I contributed to brain-wide input mapping of inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex.
