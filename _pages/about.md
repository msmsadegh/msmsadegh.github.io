I am a computer science researcher and a research associate at Shahid Beheshti University (SBU) in the Neuroengineering Lab under the supervision of Dr. Reza Lashgari. My research primarily focuses on computer vision, deep learning, and computational neuroscience. I am also actively involved in AI-driven biomedical imaging and smart contract optimization.

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in Computer Science at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT), where I worked on gas optimization in smart contracts using program analysis. My bachelorâ€™s degree is from Shiraz University, where I specialized in artificial intelligence and software engineering.

I have also collaborated with international research teams, including a project with the University of Utah, where I contributed to brain-wide input mapping of inhibitory neurons in the visual cortex.
