## Teaching Experience

I have been involved in teaching and assisting with various courses, primarily in computer science and software engineering. My experience includes both undergraduate and graduate-level instruction.

### Courses Taught or Assisted

#### **Teaching Assistant at Amirkabir University of Technology (AUT)**
- **Computer Fundamentals** – Assisted students with foundational concepts in computing.
- **Software Testing** – Guided students in software testing techniques, including unit testing, black-box testing, and debugging.
- **Computer Lab** – Supervised practical sessions and provided support for programming assignments.

### Teaching Philosophy
I emphasize hands-on learning, problem-solving, and critical thinking in my teaching approach. By incorporating real-world examples and interactive sessions, I aim to make complex topics more accessible to students.
